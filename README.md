I think about systems—how they move, break, and scale.

By day, I work on logistics infrastructure at Nash, orchestrating last-mile delivery across fleets and partners. Outside of that, I'm building things at the intersection of what interests me: robotics, autonomous systems, game theory, and the messy human side of it all.

### Currently

- **[Nash](https://nash.ai)** — Making last-mile logistics work
- **[Aeon Entertainment](https://github.com/aeon-entertainment)** — Rethinking karaoke for the modern era
- **[Altoal](https://github.com/altoal)** — Where I build what I'm curious about

### Projects

Coming soon. Building in the open takes time.
